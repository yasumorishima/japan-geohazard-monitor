# Japan Geohazard Monitor

![Live Map](docs/screenshot.png)

Real-time monitoring dashboard for Japan's geophysical activity — earthquakes, volcanoes, atmospheric conditions, geomagnetism, ocean temperature, ionosphere, and crustal deformation — all overlaid on a single dark-themed interactive map with a correlation analysis panel.

9 async collectors run continuously on a Raspberry Pi 5, pulling data from 10 public APIs and storing it in SQLite. A FastAPI server renders a Leaflet.js dashboard with togglable layers and a time-synchronized correlation panel for cross-domain anomaly detection. Mobile responsive.

## Live

`http://100.77.198.48:8003` (Tailscale)

## Architecture

```
9 async collectors (independent intervals per source)
    → BaseCollector (retry, batch insert, health tracking)
    → SQLite (WAL mode, auto-purge @ 90 days)
    → FastAPI REST API (per-layer + correlation endpoints)
    → Leaflet.js dark-themed map (togglable layers, mobile responsive)
    → Chart.js correlation panel (5 time-aligned charts)
```

**Stack**: Python 3.12 / asyncio + aiohttp + asyncssh / aiosqlite / FastAPI + Uvicorn / Leaflet.js + Chart.js / Docker

## Correlation Panel

Right-side collapsible panel (bottom sheet on mobile) with 5 time-synchronized Chart.js charts for cross-domain anomaly detection:

| Chart | Data | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Earthquake count | Hourly bar chart | 1 hour |
| Kp index | Line chart | 3 hours |
| GOES magnetic field | Hourly mean total field (nT) | 1 hour |
| Ionosphere TEC | Mean TEC over Japan (TECU) | Per IONEX epoch |
| Atmospheric pressure | Mean AMeDAS pressure (hPa) | 1 hour |

Supports 3/7/14/30-day windows. Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes when open.

**Use case**: Visual detection of precursor patterns — e.g., ionosphere TEC anomaly → geomagnetic disturbance → pressure change → earthquake sequence.

## Analysis Results (2011-2026, 28K M3+ earthquakes, 4M TEC, 44K Kp)

### Summary: all tested indicators are negative

Every indicator tested — b-value, Kp geomagnetic index, ionosphere TEC, and their combinations — showed **no statistically significant earthquake precursory signal** after proper bias correction.

Two methodological artifacts were responsible for all false positives found during the investigation:

1. **Aftershock contamination**: Without isolating independent events, clustering inflates apparent signals (b-value: 90% → 15%, Kp -12h: 62% → 11%)
2. **Sampling bias**: Using chronologically-first events over-samples the 2011 Tohoku aftershock cluster (TEC σ: 0.942 → 0.263)

### Phase 1: Single indicators — all negative

**b-value (Gutenberg-Richter) — ❌ Aftershock artifact**

| Window | Random b<0.7 | All M5+ b<0.7 | Isolated M5+ b<0.7 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7-day | 16.9% | 90.0% | **15.2%** (= random) |
| 30-day | 42.6% | 91.6% | **39.5%** (= random) |
| 90-day | 72.2% | 84.6% | **55.1%** (noise range) |

**Epicenter TEC (raw) — ❌ Systematic bias**

Random TEC drops *more* than pre-earthquake TEC (σ=-0.781 vs -0.222). Bias from seasonal/diurnal/solar cycle patterns.

**Multi-indicator grid search (100 combos) — ❌ No signal**

Best lift 1.82 at n=17. Fixed thresholds: earthquake 22.1% vs random 21.4% — identical.

### Phase 2: Candidate signals found → validated → all rejected

Two promising signals were identified during exploratory analysis. Both were then rigorously validated with aftershock isolation + balanced time sampling + alternative methods + bootstrap CI. **Both collapsed.**

**Kp -12h geomagnetic spike — ❌ Aftershock chain artifact (confirmed)**

| Lead time | All events Kp>3 | **Isolated events Kp>3** | Random Kp>3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| -24h | 55.9% | **12.2%** | 14.2% |
| -12h | 61.5% | **10.8%** | 14.0% |
| -6h | 55.1% | **10.0%** | 15.2% |

The apparent 62% Kp>3 rate was entirely from aftershock chains: the first M5+ in a cluster occurs during a Kp storm, then subsequent events in the same cluster all inherit the high Kp. Isolated events show Kp *below* random at every lead time.

**TEC detrended (seasonal correction) — ❌ Sampling bias + aftershock artifact (confirmed)**

| Condition | Before bias fix | **After bias fix** | Bootstrap p |
|---|---|---|---|
| Random | σ=+0.247, spikes 15.6% | σ=+0.247, spikes 15.6% | — |
| All M5+ | **σ=+0.942, spikes 56.5%** | σ=+0.279, spikes 19.5% | p=0.265 |
| **Isolated M5+ only** | not tested | **σ=+0.263, spikes 15.0%** | **p=0.389** |

The σ=0.942 "discovery" had two compounding artifacts:
- `target_events[:500]` selected chronologically-first events, biased toward 2011 Tohoku aftershock cluster
- Non-isolated events carried residual clustering effects

After balanced time sampling + isolation filter: mean_diff=0.016, 95% CI=[-0.106, +0.137], **indistinguishable from random**.

**Validation: temporal stability — ❌ No signal in either period**

| Period | Isolated TECσ | Random TECσ | Bootstrap p |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2011-2018 (n=1937) | 0.218 | 0.312 | p=0.833 |
| 2019-2026 (n=1178) | 0.095 | 0.183 | p=0.841 |

Isolated events show *lower* TEC than random in both periods.

**Validation: alternative detrending (30-day rolling) — ❌ Zero spikes**

| Condition | Rolling σ | Spikes (σ>+1) |
|---|---|---|
| Random | -0.666 | 0.0% |
| Isolated M5+ | -0.622 | 0.0% |

Independent detrending method confirms no signal.

**Validation: magnitude dependence (with isolation) — ❌ No monotonic increase**

| Magnitude | Isolated TECσ | Spikes |
|---|---|---|
| M5-5.9 (n=1373 iso) | 0.127 | 11.7% |
| M6-6.9 (n=160 iso) | 0.083 | 10.1% |
| M7+ (n=20 iso) | 0.370 | 20.0% |

M6 is *weaker* than M5. No physically consistent magnitude scaling.

### Key lessons

1. **Aftershock isolation is essential** — without it, every indicator shows inflated signals due to temporal clustering
2. **Sampling method matters** — chronological truncation (`[:N]`) can introduce severe bias when event rates are non-stationary (e.g., post-Tohoku)
3. **Low-resolution global indices cannot detect local precursors** — IONEX TEC (2.5°×5° grid) and Kp (global 3-hour average) spatially average away any local earthquake-related signal
4. **Always validate with multiple independent methods** — the TEC signal survived aftershock filtering OR sampling correction alone, but collapsed under both simultaneously

### Phase 2: Physics-based and statistical approaches — 3 signals found

Phase 1's fundamental limitation was **spatial resolution** — global indices dilute local signals below detection. Phase 2 attacks from 4 independent directions. Three produced signals:

**Coulomb stress transfer — CFS threshold-dependent lift (spatial control applied)**

Using Okada (1992) dislocation model with 3,060 GCMT focal mechanisms. Compared earthquake locations vs 2-5° shifted locations (controls for spatial clustering):

| CFS threshold | Earthquake % | Shifted 2-5° % | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| > 10 kPa | 63.7% | 68.6% | 0.93 (no signal) |
| > 100 kPa | 45.4% | 22.9% | **1.98** |
| > 500 kPa | 23.4% | 5.3% | **4.43** |
| > 1000 kPa | 14.7% | 2.4% | **6.03** |

Low CFS thresholds show no signal (spatial clustering effect). **High CFS (>500 kPa) shows 4-6x lift even after spatial control** — earthquakes preferentially occur at *exact* stress-enhanced locations, not just the same general region.

**Seismicity rate anomaly — 6.7x activation lift (model-free)**

Regional M3+ rate in 7 days before each M5+ event vs long-term regional average:

| Condition | Activation (>2x rate) | Quiescence (<0.5x rate) |
|---|---|---|
| Before M5+ | **47.0%** | 23.0% |
| Random | 7.0% | 75.4% |
| **Lift** | **6.71** | 0.31 |

47% of M5+ events are preceded by at least 2x normal seismicity rate in their region.

**Spatiotemporal clustering — lift 2.83, p=0.0 (validated)**

Zaliapin & Ben-Zion (2013) nearest-neighbor distance clustering:

| | Has foreshock sequence | Mean foreshock count |
|---|---|---|
| M5+ events | **14.7%** | 9.19 |
| Random M4 | 5.2% | 2.17 |
| **Lift** | **2.83** | — |

Bootstrap 95% CI: [2.01, 4.49], p=0.0. Temporally stable: 2011-2018 = 16.1%, 2019-2026 = 12.3%. Magnitude-dependent: M5 = 14.1% → M6 = 21.2%.

**High-resolution GNSS-TEC — data unavailable**

Nagoya University ISEE archive URLs returned 404 for all attempted date patterns. URL investigation needed.

### Phase 2.5: Aftershock bias validation — all 3 signals survived

Critical question: are the 3 signals independent, or just aftershock cascading? **All survived the same isolation filter that destroyed Phase 1.**

**Isolation test — signals persist for independent (non-aftershock) M5+ events**

| Signal | All M5+ | **Isolated M5+** | Random | **Isolated lift** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CFS > 500 kPa | 18.3% | **7.5%** | 0.2% | **37.5** |
| Activation > 2x | 47.0% | **14.9%** | 8.0% | **1.86** |
| Has foreshock | 68.3% | **42.8%** | 10.4% | **4.12** |

Phase 1's TEC detrended signal (σ=0.942) collapsed to σ=0.263 (p=0.389) under isolation. Phase 2's signals maintained significant lifts (37.5x, 1.86x, 4.12x).

**Time delay — isolated events show long-term Coulomb triggering (median 333 days)**

| Condition | Median delay | < 30 days | > 90 days | > 365 days |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| All M5+ | 161 days | 32.8% | 57.8% | 34.2% |
| **Isolated M5+** | **333 days** | **10.0%** | **77.5%** | **47.2%** |
| CFS > 500 kPa | 6 days | 62.4% | 32.2% | 19.9% |

Isolated events occur a median of 333 days after their nearest prior M5+ — not aftershocks but **delayed stress-triggered events**. 77.5% occur more than 90 days later.

**Signal correlation — partially independent (ratio 2.12)**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| P(all 3) if independent | 12.2% |
| P(all 3) observed | 25.9% |
| Correlation ratio | **2.12** |

Ratio of 2.12 means signals are **moderately correlated but not redundant**. They contain partially independent information — combining them is meaningful.

**Prospective test — combined score lift 20.66 in unseen data**

Combined score: count of (CFS>100, rate>2x, has foreshock) per event.

| Score | Train 2011-2018 | **Test 2019-2026** | Random |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (no signals) | 22.9% | 31.7% | **84.0%** |
| 1 | 15.6% | 27.2% | 13.4% |
| 2 | 24.0% | **33.9%** | 2.4% |
| 3 (all signals) | 37.5% | 7.2% | 0.2% |

Test period: 41.1% of M5+ events have score ≥ 2, vs 2.6% of random locations → **lift 20.66**. The model generalizes to unseen time periods.

### Phase 3a: Catalog-based methods — mostly negative

Three additional methods using existing earthquake catalog only (no new data). None added significant prediction power beyond Phase 2.

**LURR (Load-Unload Response Ratio) — ❌ No signal**

| Window | EQ LURR>1.5 | Random | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30 days | 26.3% | 55.0% | 0.48 |
| 90 days | 31.6% | 36.9% | 0.86 |
| 180 days | 28.3% | 30.2% | 0.94 |

Tidal stress asymmetry shows no earthquake-specific pattern. Random locations have equal or higher LURR values.

**Natural Time Analysis — ❌ No signal**

κ1 variance near critical value (0.070) is equally common before M5+ events and at random times (lift 0.84-1.19 across all window sizes).

**Earthquake Nowcasting — ⚠️ Weak signal (lift 1.31)**

EPS > 70 before M5+ events: 26.8% vs 20.4% random (lift 1.31). Weak magnitude dependence (M7+: 35.7%). Insufficient for standalone prediction but may complement Phase 2 signals.

### Phase 3b: Independent physical observations (in progress)

The critical next step: **non-seismological data** that is physically independent from Phase 2's earthquake-catalog-based signals.

| Parameter | Physical mechanism | Data source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MODIS thermal IR** | Stress → gas release → surface heating (LAIC model) | ORNL DAAC TESViS API (no auth, 1km) | **359 records fetched**, analysis script ready |
| **ULF magnetic field** | Stress → piezoelectric/electrokinetic emission | INTERMAGNET BGS GIN + WDC Kyoto | Fetcher rewritten, testing |
| **S-net ocean bottom pressure** | Slow-slip → seafloor displacement | NIED Hi-net portal (150 stations) | Registration needed |
| GEONET GPS-TEC (per-station) | Point TEC above epicenters | GSI GEONET RINEX | Nagoya Univ. 404, alternative needed |
| Radon / He isotopes | Fault degassing | AIST monitoring | Limited access |

**MODIS LST analysis** (Tronin 2006, Ouzounov & Freund 2004): For each M5.5+ earthquake on land, MODIS Land Surface Temperature is extracted at the epicenter ±14 days. Anomaly detection uses standardized deviation from local baseline (RST/RETIRA method, Tramutoli 2005). Tests pre-event anomaly, isolation filter, magnitude/depth dependence, and temporal profile.

**ULF magnetic analysis** (Hayakawa et al. 2007, Hattori 2004): Analyzes 1-minute geomagnetic data from KAK/MMB/KNY for three precursor signatures: (1) ULF Z-component spectral power increase, (2) Sz/Sh polarization ratio > 1 (lithospheric origin), (3) fractal dimension decrease. Nighttime-only (0-6 LT) to avoid anthropogenic noise.
