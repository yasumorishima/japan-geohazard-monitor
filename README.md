# Japan Geohazard Monitor

![Live Map](docs/screenshot.png)

Real-time monitoring dashboard for Japan's geophysical activity — earthquakes, volcanoes, atmospheric conditions, geomagnetism, ocean temperature, ionosphere, and crustal deformation — all overlaid on a single dark-themed interactive map with a correlation analysis panel.

9 async collectors run continuously on a Raspberry Pi 5, pulling data from 10 public APIs and storing it in SQLite. A FastAPI server renders a Leaflet.js dashboard with togglable layers and a time-synchronized correlation panel for cross-domain anomaly detection. Mobile responsive.

## Live

Raspberry Pi 5 + Docker（Tailscaleネットワーク内）

## Architecture

```
9 async collectors (independent intervals per source)
    → BaseCollector (retry, batch insert, health tracking)
    → SQLite (WAL mode, auto-purge @ 90 days)
    → FastAPI REST API (per-layer + correlation endpoints)
    → Leaflet.js dark-themed map (togglable layers, mobile responsive)
    → Chart.js correlation panel (5 time-aligned charts)
```

**Stack**: Python 3.12 / asyncio + aiohttp + asyncssh / aiosqlite / FastAPI + Uvicorn / scikit-learn + scipy / Leaflet.js + Chart.js / Docker

## Map Layers

| Layer | Toggle | Visualization | Color Scheme |
|---|---|---|---|
| Earthquakes | ✅ default on | CircleMarker (mag ∝ radius) | Depth: red (shallow) → blue (deep) |
| Volcanoes | toggle | Triangle markers (SVG) | Alert level: gray=1, yellow=2, orange=3, red=4, purple=5 |
| Sea Surface Temp | toggle | Rectangle grid overlay (0.5°) | Blue (cold) → green → yellow → red (warm) |

| GEONET | toggle | CircleMarker (displacement ∝ radius) | Green < 5mm, yellow < 15mm, orange < 30mm, red ≥ 30mm |
| AMeDAS | toggle | CircleMarker per station | Metric-dependent colormap (4 selectable metrics) |
| Kp Index | always | Header badge | Green < 4, Orange 4-6, Red > 6 |

## Correlation Panel

Right-side collapsible panel (bottom sheet on mobile) with 5 time-synchronized Chart.js charts for cross-domain anomaly detection:

| Chart | Data | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Earthquake count | Hourly bar chart | 1 hour |
| Kp index | Line chart | 3 hours |
| GOES magnetic field | Hourly mean total field (nT) | 1 hour |
| Ionosphere TEC | Mean TEC over Japan (TECU) | Per IONEX epoch |
| Atmospheric pressure | Mean AMeDAS pressure (hPa) | 1 hour |

Supports 3/7/14/30-day windows. Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes when open.

**Use case**: Visual detection of precursor patterns — e.g., ionosphere TEC anomaly → geomagnetic disturbance → pressure change → earthquake sequence.

Test AUC 0.7499 (best ever), CV AUC 0.7411.** Data validation: 21 OK / 8 EMPTY / 1 MISSING. Earthdata auth (4 sources) failed due to URS API deprecating Basic Auth — fixed in Phase 15b. Feature matrix exported (1790×11×11×78). Job timed out at 6h (CSEP completed, final artifact upload missed). DB checkpoint preserved
- **Analysis Phase 15b** ✅ Earthdata auth rewrite (Bearer token priority + Basic Auth fallback), ISS LIS table separation (`iss_lis_lightning`), workflow reliability (timeout 420min, ML results checkpoint artifact, auth pre-validation step). **Test AUC 0.7499 (same as 15), 72/78 active features. Feature matrix export failed (int64 serialization) → fixed in 15c**
- **Analysis Phase 15c** ⚠️ Partial success (Run 23366201702, cancelled at ML step after 6h):
  - cloud_fraction ✅ 120,727 rows (2011-01 → 2011-10, coverage 4.9%)
  - ISS LIS ✅ 537 rows (2017-03 → 2017-07, coverage 5.5%)
  - tide_gauge ❌ UHSLC ERDDAP ConnectionTimeout (CI→Hawaii latency)

- **Analysis Phase 15f** 🔄 Electron flux complete rewrite + VIIRS fix + DB checkpoint restore (Run 23382779214, 2026-03-21):
  - **DB checkpoint restore at workflow start**: previous run's DB downloaded before fetch → all skip-logic effective (incremental fetch)
  - **Electron flux**: NCEI GOES-R SEISS L2 netCDF added (GOES-16 science + GOES-18 science/ops auto-fallback). Tested: 2024=366d, 2025=342d/12mo, 2026=79d/3mo — **zero gap from 2017 to present**.

## Analysis Results (2011-2026, 29K M3+ earthquakes, 4M TEC, 44K Kp, 31K GNSS-TEC, 1.3M ULF, 78 features with dynamic selection)

### Summary

Phase 1 indicators (b-value, Kp, low-res TEC) were all negative after bias correction. Phase 2 found 3 physics-based signals that survived aftershock isolation and prospective testing. **Phase 4 forward-looking evaluation achieved 62.5% precision (7.8x gain) by combining ETAS residual + cumulative CFS + foreshock alarms.**

Two methodological artifacts were responsible for all false positives found during the investigation:

1. **Aftershock contamination**: Without isolating independent events, clustering inflates apparent signals (b-value: 90% → 15%, Kp -12h: 62% → 11%)
2. **Sampling bias**: Using chronologically-first events over-samples the 2011 Tohoku aftershock cluster (TEC σ: 0.942 → 0.263)

### Phase 1: Single indicators — all negative

**b-value (Gutenberg-Richter) — ❌ Aftershock artifact**

| Window | Random b<0.7 | All M5+ b<0.7 | Isolated M5+ b<0.7 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7-day | 16.9% | 90.0% | **15.2%** (= random) |
| 30-day | 42.6% | 91.6% | **39.5%** (= random) |
| 90-day | 72.2% | 84.6% | **55.1%** (noise range) |

**Epicenter TEC (raw) — ❌ Systematic bias**

Random TEC drops *more* than pre-earthquake TEC (σ=-0.781 vs -0.222). Bias from seasonal/diurnal/solar cycle patterns.

**Multi-indicator grid search (100 combos) — ❌ No signal**

Best lift 1.82 at n=17. Fixed thresholds: earthquake 22.1% vs random 21.4% — identical.

### Phase 2: Candidate signals found → validated → all rejected

Two promising signals were identified during exploratory analysis. Both were then rigorously validated with aftershock isolation + balanced time sampling + alternative methods + bootstrap CI. **Both collapsed.**

**Kp -12h geomagnetic spike — ❌ Aftershock chain artifact (confirmed)**

| Lead time | All events Kp>3 | **Isolated events Kp>3** | Random Kp>3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| -24h | 55.9% | **12.2%** | 14.2% |
| -12h | 61.5% | **10.8%** | 14.0% |
| -6h | 55.1% | **10.0%** | 15.2% |

The apparent 62% Kp>3 rate was entirely from aftershock chains: the first M5+ in a cluster occurs during a Kp storm, then subsequent events in the same cluster all inherit the high Kp. Isolated events show Kp *below* random at every lead time.

**TEC detrended (seasonal correction) — ❌ Sampling bias + aftershock artifact (confirmed)**

| Condition | Before bias fix | **After bias fix** | Bootstrap p |
|---|---|---|---|
| Random | σ=+0.247, spikes 15.6% | σ=+0.247, spikes 15.6% | — |
| All M5+ | **σ=+0.942, spikes 56.5%** | σ=+0.279, spikes 19.5% | p=0.265 |
| **Isolated M5+ only** | not tested | **σ=+0.263, spikes 15.0%** | **p=0.389** |

The σ=0.942 "discovery" had two compounding artifacts:
- `target_events[:500]` selected chronologically-first events, biased toward 2011 Tohoku aftershock cluster
- Non-isolated events carried residual clustering effects

After balanced time sampling + isolation filter: mean_diff=0.016, 95% CI=[-0.106, +0.137], **indistinguishable from random**.

**Validation: temporal stability — ❌ No signal in either period**

| Period | Isolated TECσ | Random TECσ | Bootstrap p |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2011-2018 (n=1937) | 0.218 | 0.312 | p=0.833 |
| 2019-2026 (n=1178) | 0.095 | 0.183 | p=0.841 |

Isolated events show *lower* TEC than random in both periods.

**Validation: alternative detrending (30-day rolling) — ❌ Zero spikes**

| Condition | Rolling σ | Spikes (σ>+1) |
|---|---|---|
| Random | -0.666 | 0.0% |
| Isolated M5+ | -0.622 | 0.0% |

Independent detrending method confirms no signal.

**Validation: magnitude dependence (with isolation) — ❌ No monotonic increase**

| Magnitude | Isolated TECσ | Spikes |
|---|---|---|
| M5-5.9 (n=1373 iso) | 0.127 | 11.7% |
| M6-6.9 (n=160 iso) | 0.083 | 10.1% |
| M7+ (n=20 iso) | 0.370 | 20.0% |

M6 is *weaker* than M5. No physically consistent magnitude scaling.

### Key lessons

1. **Aftershock isolation is essential** — without it, every indicator shows inflated signals due to temporal clustering
2. **Sampling method matters** — chronological truncation (`[:N]`) can introduce severe bias when event rates are non-stationary (e.g., post-Tohoku)
3. **Low-resolution global indices cannot detect local precursors** — IONEX TEC (2.5°×5° grid) and Kp (global 3-hour average) spatially average away any local earthquake-related signal
4. **Always validate with multiple independent methods** — the TEC signal survived aftershock filtering OR sampling correction alone, but collapsed under both simultaneously

### Phase 2: Physics-based and statistical approaches — 3 signals found

Phase 1's fundamental limitation was **spatial resolution** — global indices dilute local signals below detection. Phase 2 attacks from 4 independent directions. Three produced signals:

**Coulomb stress transfer — CFS threshold-dependent lift (spatial control applied)**

Using Okada (1992) dislocation model with 3,060 GCMT focal mechanisms. Compared earthquake locations vs 2-5° shifted locations (controls for spatial clustering):

| CFS threshold | Earthquake % | Shifted 2-5° % | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| > 10 kPa | 63.7% | 68.6% | 0.93 (no signal) |
| > 100 kPa | 45.4% | 22.9% | **1.98** |
| > 500 kPa | 23.4% | 5.3% | **4.43** |
| > 1000 kPa | 14.7% | 2.4% | **6.03** |

Low CFS thresholds show no signal (spatial clustering effect). **High CFS (>500 kPa) shows 4-6x lift even after spatial control** — earthquakes preferentially occur at *exact* stress-enhanced locations, not just the same general region.

**Seismicity rate anomaly — 6.7x activation lift (model-free)**

Regional M3+ rate in 7 days before each M5+ event vs long-term regional average:

| Condition | Activation (>2x rate) | Quiescence (<0.5x rate) |
|---|---|---|
| Before M5+ | **47.0%** | 23.0% |
| Random | 7.0% | 75.4% |
| **Lift** | **6.71** | 0.31 |

47% of M5+ events are preceded by at least 2x normal seismicity rate in their region.

**Spatiotemporal clustering — lift 2.83, p=0.0 (validated)**

Zaliapin & Ben-Zion (2013) nearest-neighbor distance clustering:

| | Has foreshock sequence | Mean foreshock count |
|---|---|---|
| M5+ events | **14.7%** | 9.19 |
| Random M4 | 5.2% | 2.17 |
| **Lift** | **2.83** | — |

Bootstrap 95% CI: [2.01, 4.49], p=0.0. Temporally stable: 2011-2018 = 16.1%, 2019-2026 = 12.3%. Magnitude-dependent: M5 = 14.1% → M6 = 21.2%.

**High-resolution GNSS-TEC — data unavailable**

Nagoya University ISEE archive URLs returned 404 for all attempted date patterns. URL investigation needed.

### Phase 2.5: Aftershock bias validation — all 3 signals survived

Critical question: are the 3 signals independent, or just aftershock cascading? **All survived the same isolation filter that destroyed Phase 1.**

**Isolation test — signals persist for independent (non-aftershock) M5+ events**

| Signal | All M5+ | **Isolated M5+** | Random | **Isolated lift** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CFS > 500 kPa | 18.3% | **7.5%** | 0.2% | **37.5** |
| Activation > 2x | 47.0% | **14.9%** | 8.0% | **1.86** |
| Has foreshock | 68.3% | **42.8%** | 10.4% | **4.12** |

Phase 1's TEC detrended signal (σ=0.942) collapsed to σ=0.263 (p=0.389) under isolation. Phase 2's signals maintained significant lifts (37.5x, 1.86x, 4.12x).

**Time delay — isolated events show long-term Coulomb triggering (median 333 days)**

| Condition | Median delay | < 30 days | > 90 days | > 365 days |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| All M5+ | 161 days | 32.8% | 57.8% | 34.2% |
| **Isolated M5+** | **333 days** | **10.0%** | **77.5%** | **47.2%** |
| CFS > 500 kPa | 6 days | 62.4% | 32.2% | 19.9% |

Isolated events occur a median of 333 days after their nearest prior M5+ — not aftershocks but **delayed stress-triggered events**. 77.5% occur more than 90 days later.

**Signal correlation — partially independent (ratio 2.12)**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| P(all 3) if independent | 12.2% |
| P(all 3) observed | 25.9% |
| Correlation ratio | **2.12** |

Ratio of 2.12 means signals are **moderately correlated but not redundant**. They contain partially independent information — combining them is meaningful.

**Prospective test — combined score lift 20.66 in unseen data**

Combined score: count of (CFS>100, rate>2x, has foreshock) per event.

| Score | Train 2011-2018 | **Test 2019-2026** | Random |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (no signals) | 22.9% | 31.7% | **84.0%** |
| 1 | 15.6% | 27.2% | 13.4% |
| 2 | 24.0% | **33.9%** | 2.4% |
| 3 (all signals) | 37.5% | 7.2% | 0.2% |

Test period: 41.1% of M5+ events have score ≥ 2, vs 2.6% of random locations → **lift 20.66**. The model generalizes to unseen time periods.

### Phase 3a: Catalog-based methods — mostly negative

Three additional methods using existing earthquake catalog only (no new data). None added significant prediction power beyond Phase 2.

**LURR (Load-Unload Response Ratio) — ❌ No signal**

| Window | EQ LURR>1.5 | Random | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30 days | 26.3% | 55.0% | 0.48 |
| 90 days | 31.6% | 36.9% | 0.86 |
| 180 days | 28.3% | 30.2% | 0.94 |

Tidal stress asymmetry shows no earthquake-specific pattern. Random locations have equal or higher LURR values.

**Natural Time Analysis — ❌ No signal**

κ1 variance near critical value (0.070) is equally common before M5+ events and at random times (lift 0.84-1.19 across all window sizes).

**Earthquake Nowcasting — ⚠️ Weak signal (lift 1.31)**

EPS > 70 before M5+ events: 26.8% vs 20.4% random (lift 1.31). Weak magnitude dependence (M7+: 35.7%). Insufficient for standalone prediction but may complement Phase 2 signals.

### Phase 3b: Independent physical observations (in progress)

The critical next step: **non-seismological data** that is physically independent from Phase 2's earthquake-catalog-based signals.

| **ULF magnetic field** | Stress → piezoelectric/electrokinetic emission | INTERMAGNET BGS GIN + WDC Kyoto | Fetcher rewritten, testing |
| **S-net ocean bottom pressure** | Slow-slip → seafloor displacement | NIED Hi-net portal (150 stations) | Registration needed |

**MODIS LST analysis** (Tronin 2006, Ouzounov & Freund 2004): For each M5.5+ earthquake on land, MODIS Land Surface Temperature is extracted at the epicenter ±14 days. Anomaly detection uses standardized deviation from local baseline (RST/RETIRA method, Tramutoli 2005). Tests pre-event anomaly, isolation filter, magnitude/depth dependence, and temporal profile.

**ULF magnetic analysis** (Hayakawa et al. 2007, Hattori 2004): Analyzes 1-minute geomagnetic data from KAK/MMB/KNY for three precursor signatures: (1) ULF Z-component spectral power increase, (2) Sz/Sh polarization ratio > 1 (lithospheric origin), (3) fractal dimension decrease. Nighttime-only (0-6 LT) to avoid anthropogenic noise.

### Phase 3b: Independent physical observations — MODIS ❌, ULF ⚠️

**MODIS Land Surface Temperature — ❌ No thermal precursor signal**

Pre-earthquake 7-day anomaly: mean=0.061σ, 95% CI=[-0.109, 0.224], >2σ = 0.0%. The LAIC thermal precursor hypothesis (Tronin 2006) is not supported in this dataset.

**ULF Magnetic — ⚠️ Strong retrospective signal, forward evaluation pending**

| Station | Events | Power ratio (pre/post) | Sz/Sh polarization | Fractal dim |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KAK | 439 | **mean 7.9x**, >2x = 53% | pre=0.98 > post=0.34 | pre=1.27 < post=1.33 |

All three ULF precursor signatures are present (power increase, lithospheric polarization, fractal regularization). **However, data covers only 2011-01-05 to 2011-05-05 (80 days including Tohoku M9)** — aftershock contamination is almost certain. Full-period data needed for prospective evaluation.

### Phase 4: Prospective (forward-looking) prediction — **gain up to 7.8x**

The fundamental shift: from "given earthquake, was there anomaly?" to **"given anomaly now, will earthquake follow?"** Evaluated on 2019-2026 (unseen data), with spatially-resolved base rates per 2°×2° cell.

| Signal | Alarms | Precision | Recall | **Prob. Gain** | IGPE (bits) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Combined (ETAS+CFS+fore) ≥2** | **16** | **62.5%** | 2.5% | **7.8x** | **2.96** |
| ETAS residual > 5x | 38 | 52.6% | 6.8% | 4.0x | 1.99 |
| Foreshock ≥ 10 | 74 | 39.2% | 8.8% | **5.1x** | 2.36 |
| Foreshock ≥ 5 | 257 | 34.2% | 16.3% | 4.1x | 2.04 |
| ETAS residual > 3x | 71 | 47.9% | 8.2% | 3.8x | 1.92 |
| Rate > 5x | 464 | 19.0% | 14.4% | 4.2x | 2.09 |
| Cumulative CFS > 100 kPa | 440 | 19.8% | 3.7% | 2.4x | 1.25 |

**Key finding**: When ETAS residual, cumulative CFS, and foreshock alarms fire simultaneously, 62.5% of the time an M5+ earthquake follows within 7 days — **7.8 times better than random**. The ETAS residual (rate exceeding aftershock model prediction) is the strongest individual signal at 52.6% precision.

**Pattern Informatics (Rundle 2003)**: Prospective Molchan AUC = 0.349 (< 0.5 = better than random). PI hotspots preferentially attract future M5+ events. Top hotspots: Iburi (42.75°N), Izu-Bonin (32.75°N, 29.75°N).

### Shared modules (`src/`)

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `physics.py` | Okada (1992) CFS, Wells & Coppersmith (1994) fault scaling, ETAS MLE (scipy L-BFGS-B), Dieterich (1994) rate-and-state, b-value (Aki-Utsu), tectonic zone classification, GNSS strain rate estimation, slow-slip transient detection |
| `features.py` | **78 features** with dynamic selection across **22 optional groups**: rate dynamics (acceleration, trend), zone-specific ETAS residuals, magnitude statistics (deficit, b-value trend), clustering (foreshock escalation, inter-event CV), rate-and-state CFS, Pattern Informatics, Benioff strain, GNSS crustal deformation (displacement, strain rate, SSE detection), enhanced spatial (neighbor CFS/ETAS/mag, zone rate anomaly, CFS rank, spatial gradient), **cosmic ray** (27-day baseline deviation, trend), **geomagnetic spectral** (ULF power, polarization, fractal dim), **OLR anomaly**, **Earth rotation** (LOD rate, polar motion speed), **solar wind** (Bz, dynamic pressure, Dst), **GRACE gravity** anomaly rate, **SO2 column** anomaly, **soil moisture** anomaly, **tide gauge** residual, **ocean color** chlorophyll anomaly, **cloud fraction** anomaly, **nightlight** airglow anomaly, **InSAR** deformation rate, **X-ray flux** (solar flare proxy), **proton flux** (SEP events), **tidal shear stress** + rate (lunar+solar), **particle precipitation** (Van Allen belt), **DART bottom pressure** (anomaly + rate), **IOC sea level** anomaly, **S-net seafloor pressure** anomaly. `get_active_feature_names()` auto-excludes groups with no data. **Performance**: bisect-based O(log n) window queries, per-day zone stats cache, deque histories — optimized for 100K+ extract() calls per target |

### Phase 5 ML Results (AUC 0.73, AdaBoost baseline)

| Metric | Train | Test |
|---|---|---|
| AUC-ROC | 0.7588 | 0.7334 |

| Feature | Single AUC | Ensemble weight |
|---|---|---|
| cfs_cumulative | **0.7151** | 23.3% (35 stumps) |
| pi_score | **0.7098** | 12.2% (28 stumps) |
| days_since_m5 | 0.6735 | 1.4% |
| rate_30d | 0.6311 | 6.2% |
| n_foreshock | 0.6062 | 8.7% |
| etas_residual | 0.5597 | 5.0% |
| b_value | 0.5166 | 41.0% (38 stumps, but ~random AUC) |

**Key insight**: CFS cumulative and Pattern Informatics are the strongest individual predictors. ETAS residual underperformed (AUC 0.56) due to fixed literature parameters — Phase 6 addresses this with MLE fitting. b-value consumed most ensemble weight (41%) despite near-random AUC (0.52), indicating AdaBoost overfitting.

### Phase 6 ML Results (AUC 0.746, HistGradientBoosting)

Major overhaul: 35 temporal features, sklearn HistGradientBoosting, walk-forward CV, zone-specific ETAS MLE, rate-and-state CFS, isotonic calibration.

| Metric | Phase 5 | Phase 6 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUC-ROC (train) | 0.759 | 0.822 | +0.063 |
| AUC-ROC (test) | 0.733 | **0.746** | **+0.013** |
| Walk-Forward CV mean AUC | — | **0.740 ± 0.016** | new |
| Molchan Skill | — | **0.425** | new (>0 = better than random) |

**Walk-Forward CV (9 folds)**: All folds AUC 0.71–0.77, std=0.016. Confirms no overfitting.

**ETAS MLE (7 tectonic zones — all converged)**:

| Zone | Branching Ratio | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Hokkaido | 0.23 | Lowest aftershock activity |
| Tohoku Offshore | 0.42 | Moderate |
| Kanto-Tokai | 0.51 | Active subduction interface |
| Kyushu | **0.66** | Strongest aftershock chains |
| Nankai | alpha=1.9 | Large events trigger disproportionately |

**Top features (permutation importance)**:

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Single AUC |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cfs_cumulative_kpa` | **0.107** | 0.715 |
| 2 | `neighbor_rate_sum` | — | — |
| 3 | `days_since_m4` | — | — |
| 4 | `pi_score` | — | — |
| 5 | `cfs_recent_kpa` | — | — |

CFS cumulative remains the dominant predictor, consistent across Phase 5→6. The physics-based Coulomb stress signal is robust.

**Prospective evaluation (2019-2026)**: Combined alarm (ETAS+CFS+foreshock ≥2) gain = 7.79x, FA rate = 0.375 — consistent with Phase 4 results (7.8x).

**Remaining challenges**: Threshold precision-recall tradeoff is steep (thresh 0.5: recall 3.5%, precision 35.6%; thresh 0.2: recall 46%, precision 23.8%). ULF alarm gain = 0.

### Phase 7 Results (AUC 0.749, 47 features + spatial smoothing)

Expanded from 35 to 47 features to capture spatial correlation and crustal deformation signals:

| Category | New Features | Physical Motivation |
|---|---|---|
| GNSS crustal deformation (6) | displacement, acceleration, vertical rate, strain rate, anomaly count, transient (SSE) score | Slow-slip events precede megathrust earthquakes (Kato 2012); strain accumulation detectable by GEONET |
| Enhanced spatial (6) | neighbor CFS max, neighbor ETAS residual max, zone rate anomaly, zone CFS rank, spatial gradient, neighbor max magnitude | Earthquakes cluster spatially; stress transfer affects neighboring cells |

| Metric | Phase 6 | Phase 7 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUC-ROC (test) | 0.746 | **0.749** | +0.003 |
| Walk-Forward CV | 0.740 | **0.741** | +0.001 |

Additional changes: zone-specific ETAS parameters injected into feature extraction (was global), 2-pass Gaussian spatial smoothing of cell predictions. The +0.003 improvement indicates the feature engineering ceiling is being reached — motivating Phase 8's structural approach.

### Phase 8: Structural Overhaul

Phase 7 showed diminishing returns from feature engineering (+0.003 with 12 new features). Phase 8 attacks from 4 structural directions.

**Phase 8.0 results (multi-target + CSEP + stacking + ConvLSTM export)**:

| Target | CV AUC (pooled) | Test AUC | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| M5+ | 0.7413 | **0.7490** | No regression from Phase 7 (0.749) |
| M5.5+ | 0.6671 | — | New target, fewer positives |
| M6+ | 0.5858 | 0.6595 (smoothed) | Only 2.3% positive, spatial smoothing +0.052 |

Phase 8.0 revealed critical bugs in stacking:
- **Physics alarm AUC = 0.500 (constant)**: physics alarms were generated on a fixed 3-day grid while ML level-0 used different t_days precision → fuzzy matching ≈ 0% hit rate → all physics features defaulted to constants
- **Logistic stacking AUC = 0.27 (collapsed)**: constant physics features + unscaled feature values (ML prob 0-1 vs CFS 0-1000+ kPa) caused gradient explosion
- **Isotonic stacking AUC = 0.741**: survived by averaging all inputs (scale-invariant), but couldn't improve on ML alone
- **CSEP benchmark used single static forecast**: averaged all test-period predictions into one forecast, applied to all sliding windows

**Phase 8.1 fixes** (3 root causes addressed):
1. Physics alarm alignment: `export_physics_alarms()` now reads ML level-0 keys and generates features at exact same (cell, t_days) coordinates → match rate 0% → 100%
2. Logistic standardization: feature standardization (zero mean, unit variance) before gradient descent
3. Dynamic CSEP: per-window ML forecast reconstruction from level-0 predictions

### Phase 9: Non-Traditional Precursor Data Sources (47 → 56 features)

Phase 7-8 showed diminishing returns from seismological features (+0.003 per phase). Phase 9 introduces **physically independent data domains** — cosmic rays, animal behavior, lightning, and continuous geomagnetic monitoring — to break the AUC 0.74 ceiling through ensemble diversity.

| Data Source | Physical Mechanism | Reference | Features Added |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NMDB cosmic rays** | Crustal stress → geomagnetic field change → cosmic ray deflection (15-day lag) | Homola et al. (2023) J. Atmos. Sol.-Terr. Phys. 247:106068 | cosmic_ray_rate, cosmic_ray_anomaly, cosmic_ray_trend_15d |
| **INTERMAGNET hourly** | Continuous ULF monitoring enables spectral analysis: power, polarization, fractal dimension | Hattori (2004) NHESS; Hayakawa (2007) | geomag_ulf_power, geomag_polarization, geomag_fractal_dim |
| **Blitzortung lightning** | Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling: radon → ionization → atmospheric E-field → lightning anomaly | Pulinets & Ouzounov (2011) NHESS 11:3247 | lightning_count_7d, lightning_anomaly |
| **Movebank animal GPS** | Animals detect pre-seismic EM emissions, radon, or infrasound 1-20 hours before M3.8+ | Wikelski et al. (2020) Ethology 126:931 | animal_speed_anomaly |
| **CSES satellite** | Ionospheric EM anomalies detected by Zhangheng-1 satellite (2018+) | Zhima et al. (2020) Space Weather | (best effort, auth required) |

**Phase 9.0 results (initial deployment — data source failures)**:

| Data Source | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| NMDB cosmic rays | ✅ 14,565 records (IRKT/OULU/PSNM) | — |
| Blitzortung lightning | ❌ JSONDecodeError | Archive returns HTML (access restricted), not detected |
| INTERMAGNET hourly | ❌ HTTP 400 on all requests | 3 API parameter errors: `SamplesPerDay=24` (invalid), date format with TZ, wrong publicationState |
| Movebank animal GPS | ❌ No data | No public GPS tracking studies in Japan region |

With only cosmic ray data available and 6 zero-filled features injected as noise, **CV AUC dropped from 0.741 to 0.728** — a clear demonstration that constant-zero features degrade tree-based models.

Cosmic ray feature importance (small but positive): `cosmic_ray_rate` = 0.0062, `cosmic_ray_anomaly` = 0.0029.

**Phase 9.1 fixes (4 bugs + dynamic feature selection + metadata fix)**:

| Fix | Root Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| INTERMAGNET API | `SamplesPerDay=24` doesn't exist; date format with `T00:00:00Z` rejected; `adj-or-rep` is not a valid publicationState | `samplesPerDay=1440` (minute data) + hourly downsample, `yyyy-mm-dd` only, `best-avail`. 7-day batch to reduce requests ~7x |
| Lightning SQL | Query references `mean_intensity_ka` column and `source` column — neither exists in the `lightning` table | Fixed to `mean_intensity`, removed `WHERE source != 'climatology'` |
| Blitzortung HTML | Archive returns HTML login page with HTTP 200, parsed as JSON → crash | Content-Type check + body prefix detection (`<!DOCTYPE`, `<html>`) |
| Zero-feature noise | Phase 9 features with no data default to 0.0, degrading model | `get_active_feature_names()` dynamically excludes feature groups whose data source returned empty |
| `metadata` NameError | `train_final_model()` used `metadata` variable but it was never passed as parameter | Added `metadata` parameter + caller updated. Crash prevented feature importance, level-0 export, and stacking |

**Phase 9.1 results**:

| Metric | Phase 8.1 | Phase 9.1 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV AUC (pooled) | 0.741 | **0.7316** | INTERMAGNET geomag data added but not yet improving |
| Test AUC | 0.748 | **0.7452** | Stable on holdout set |
| Active features | 47 | **53/56** | 3 excluded: lightning, animal, cosmic_ray_trend |

INTERMAGNET: 36,000 hourly records (KAK/MMB/KNY × 500 days). Blitzortung: Sferics Bonn server unreachable (ECONNREFUSED), archive non-public. Lightning data currently unavailable from any free source.

CV fold AUCs: 0.738, 0.689, 0.721, 0.743, 0.766, 0.756, 0.733, 0.742, 0.726

### Phase 10: Unconventional Data Sources (65 features)

Phase 9 showed that non-traditional data can contribute (cosmic ray importance > 0), but most sources failed due to API issues. Phase 10 takes a different approach: **cast a wide net across physically independent domains** that are largely unexplored in earthquake ML. The hypothesis is that since nobody has successfully predicted earthquakes, conventional approaches are insufficient — signal may exist in overlooked data.

| Data Source | Physical Mechanism (speculative) | Access | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NOAA OLR daily** | Crustal stress → radon → aerosol → cloud → OLR anomaly (LAIC model, broad-scale) | THREDDS NCSS, **no auth** | olr_anomaly |
| **IERS Earth Orientation** | LOD changes reflect angular momentum transfer → differential plate stress. **Novel in earthquake ML** | CSV download, **no auth** | lod_rate, polar_motion_speed |
| **NASA OMNIWeb solar wind** | Solar wind → magnetospheric compression → induced telluric currents → fault stress modulation. Richer than Kp (raw hourly Bz, pressure, Dst) | FTP, **no auth** | sw_bz_min_24h, sw_pressure_max_24h, dst_min_24h |
| **GRACE/GRACE-FO gravity** | Pre-seismic fluid migration → gravity change. Documented before 2011 Tohoku M9 (Matsuo & Heki 2011) | PO.DAAC OPeNDAP, Earthdata | gravity_anomaly_rate |
| **OMI SO2 column** | Tectonic stress → volcanic conduit permeability → degassing rate change | GES DISC OPeNDAP, Earthdata | so2_column_anomaly |
| **SMAP soil moisture** | Crustal strain → pore pressure → anomalous surface moisture near faults | AppEEARS API, Earthdata | soil_moisture_anomaly |

No-auth sources (OLR, EOP, solar wind, tide gauge, InSAR) are fetched immediately. Earthdata sources use `EARTHDATA_TOKEN` secret (configured) and are auto-excluded by dynamic feature selection if unavailable.

**Phase 10b: "Earth's screams" — listening to every channel**

The crust under stress doesn't just shake — it emits heat, changes gravity, alters ocean chemistry, modifies cloud patterns, and shifts the Earth's rotation. Phase 10b adds 5 additional channels:

| Data Source | Physical Mechanism | Access | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UHSLC tide gauge** | Slow slip → seafloor displacement → coastal sea level anomaly | UHSLC CSV, **no auth** | tide_residual_anomaly |
| **MODIS ocean color** | Submarine hydrothermal/volcanic activity → nutrient upwelling → chlorophyll change | OB.DAAC OPeNDAP, Earthdata | ocean_color_anomaly |
| **MODIS cloud fraction** | Radon → ionization → condensation nuclei → linear cloud formation along faults (LAIC) | LAADS OPeNDAP, Earthdata | cloud_fraction_anomaly |
| **VIIRS nighttime light** | Acoustic-gravity waves from pre-seismic ground motion → airglow modulation at 90km | EOG composites / LAADS, Earthdata | nightlight_anomaly |
| **Sentinel-1 InSAR** | Pre-seismic strain accumulation → mm-scale ground deformation (continuous spatial coverage vs GEONET point measurements) | COMET LiCSAR, **no auth** | insar_deformation_rate |

**Total: 70 features from 15 independent data domains.** Dynamic feature selection ensures only groups with actual data are used — no zero-filled noise.

**Phase 10/10b results (Run 23251928585 — success 2026-03-18)**:

| Metric | Phase 9.1 | Phase 10/10b | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV AUC (pooled) | **0.7316** | 0.7249 | **Regression**: noisy features from Solar Wind |
| Test AUC | 0.7452 | 0.7426 | Slight drop |
| Active features | 53/56 | **58/70** | 12 groups excluded (no data) |

11 new data sources, but **only Solar Wind succeeded**. All others failed:

| Source | Status | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Solar Wind | ✅ | OMNI2 hourly data fetched |
| OLR | ❌ | NOAA NCEI THREDDS filename pattern wrong (all years 404) |
| IERS EOP | ❌ | datacenter.iers.org URL changed (404) |
| Tide gauge | ❌ | UHSLC CSV path doesn't exist (404) |
| GRACE/SO2/SMAP/Ocean/Cloud/Nightlight | ❌ | Earthdata Bearer token stripped on cross-origin redirect |
| InSAR | ❌ | LiCSAR has no Japan frames |

Stacking: Logistic AUC 0.7294, Isotonic 0.7157 — **both worse than best single model (0.7426)** due to correlated M5+/M5.5+/M6+ inputs.

CV fold AUCs: 0.704, 0.688, 0.735, 0.734, 0.760, 0.751, 0.721, 0.746, 0.712

### Phase 11: Space/Cosmic Data Sources (75 features)

4 additional space/cosmic data sources — all using publicly available data with no authentication:

| Data Source | Physical Mechanism | Access | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GOES X-ray flux** | Solar flare → ionospheric disturbance → geomagnetically induced currents | NOAA SWPC JSON, **no auth** | xray_flux_max_24h |
| **GOES proton flux** | Solar energetic particle events → atmospheric ionization → telluric current anomalies | NOAA SWPC JSON, **no auth** | proton_flux_max_24h |
| **Tidal shear stress** | Lunar + solar tidal loading modulates fault stress (Cochran 2004). **Pure calculation, no external data** | Computed from ephemeris | tidal_shear_stress, tidal_stress_rate |
| **Particle precipitation** | Van Allen belt electron precipitation → ionospheric conductivity change → GIC | NOAA SWPC JSON, **no auth** | particle_precip_rate |

**Total: 75 features from 19 independent data domains.**

### Phase 12: Data Acquisition Infrastructure Overhaul + Performance Optimization

Phase 10/10b revealed that the data acquisition layer was fundamentally broken — not a configuration issue, but structural failures in URL patterns, authentication flow, and ML feature selection. Phase 12 addresses all three layers simultaneously.

**Data source fixes (12 files changed)**:

| Fix | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| **OLR** | NOAA NCEI THREDDS per-year files (all 404) | NOAA PSL THREDDS NCSS single dataset (1974-present) |
| **IERS EOP** | datacenter.iers.org (404) + USNO (stale) | OBSPM Paris Observatory eopc04 (primary, daily updated) |
| **Tide gauge** | UHSLC CSV path (404) | UHSLC Fast Delivery `.dat` format |
| **Earthdata auth** | `Bearer` token in `Authorization` header (stripped by aiohttp on cross-origin redirect) | Shared `earthdata_auth.py`: intercept 302 redirect, send Bearer to URS, follow back with cookies |

**Data acquisition confirmed working (Phase 12 Run 23271449051)**:

All data fetch steps succeeded — OLR (1m37s), IERS EOP (2s), tide gauge (29m), GOES X-ray/Proton/Electron, tidal stress, GRACE (1m), SO2 (3m41s). The data infrastructure overhaul is validated.

**ML pipeline fix — feature stability selection**:

The Phase 10/10b regression (0.7316 → 0.7249) demonstrated that HistGradientBoosting's L2 regularization alone cannot prevent noisy features from hurting performance. Added a 2-stage approach:

1. **Stage 1: Stability pre-filter** — Quick 3-fold preliminary CV on 80% of data. For each fold, train lightweight model and compute permutation importance. Keep only features with importance > 0.001 in ≥ 2/3 folds. Base 35 features always retained.
2. **Stage 2: Standard CV** — Walk-forward CV and final model use only stable features.

This structurally prevents the "more features = worse AUC" problem that plagued Phase 9.0 and 10/10b.

**Phase 12b: FeatureExtractor performance optimization**:

Phase 12 Run timed out at "Run ML integrated prediction" step (~20 hours). Root cause: `extract()` is called ~100K+ times per target (cells × time steps × 3 targets), and multiple O(n) operations per call created O(n²) total complexity.

| Optimization | Before | After | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Window queries (`_events_in_window`) | O(n) linear scan × 9 per call | O(log n) `bisect` on pre-sorted arrays | **Critical**: eliminates ~900K linear scans |
| Zone statistics | O(all_cells) scan per call | Per-day cache (computed once, shared across cells) | **Critical**: eliminates O(100K × 100) grid scans |
| Foreshock counting | O(9 cells × n) linear scan | O(9 × log n) `bisect` | High |
| Neighbor spatial (Section M) | Re-scans all 8 neighbors | Reuses Section J cached rates | Medium |
| ETAS prior extraction | O(n) list comprehension | O(log n) `bisect` slice | Medium |
| History structures | `list` with manual truncation | `deque(maxlen=N)` auto-truncation | Medium |
| Date string | `datetime` + `strftime` per call | Per-day cache (same for all cells) | Lower |
| GNSS transient | Full history scan | 180-day window limit | Lower |
| CFS rank within zone | `sorted()` + linear count per call | Pre-sorted list + `bisect_right` | Lower |

Expected speedup: **5-15x** on FeatureExtractor, enabling ML step to complete within the 6-hour timeout.

**Phase 12b result**: extract() runtime reduced from ~20 hours (timeout) to **12 minutes**. However, ML step crashed due to `deque` slice bug (`pi_hist[-3:]` → `TypeError: sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'`). Fixed in Phase 13 commit.

### Phase 13: Seafloor / Ocean Bottom Data Sources (79 features)

The seafloor is the highest-sensitivity domain for detecting pre-seismic deformation on subduction zones. Japan has the world's densest seafloor observation network, yet this data has been largely unexplored in earthquake ML.

| Data Source | Physical Mechanism | Access | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NOAA DART** | Seafloor vertical displacement → bottom pressure change (sub-Pa) | NDBC HTTP, **no auth** | dart_pressure_anomaly, dart_pressure_rate |
| **IOC Sea Level** | Slow-slip → coastal sea level anomaly | IOC REST API, **no auth** | ioc_sealevel_anomaly |
| **NIED S-net** | Sub-Pa pressure at Japan Trench subduction zone (150 stations) | HinetPy, **NIED registration** | snet_pressure_anomaly |

DART stations near Japan: 21413 (Izu-Bonin, 30.5°N), 21418 (Japan Trench/Tohoku, 38.7°N), 21419 (Kuril, 44.4°N), 21416 (Kuril N, 48.1°N), 52404 (Philippine Sea/Ryukyu, 20.6°N).

S-net: 150 stations along the Japan Trench connected by fiber-optic cables. Water pressure gauges with sub-Pa precision at 10 Hz. Registration submitted 2026-03-19, awaiting approval.

**Data licensing**: All 19 data source policies documented in [DATA_LICENSES.md](DATA_LICENSES.md) with severity levels (🔴strict/🟡non-commercial/🟢citation/⚪public domain) and pre-publication checklist.

### Phase 13: Seafloor / Ocean Bottom Data — **CV AUC 0.7416** (best ever)

| Metric | Phase 10/10b | Phase 13 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV AUC (pooled) | 0.7249 | **0.7416** | **+0.0167** |
| Test AUC | 0.7426 | **0.7481** | +0.0055 |
| Active features | 58/70 | **64/79** | +6 (DART pressure) |

Recovery from Phase 10/10b regression — stability selection effectively filters noisy features while keeping informative ones. DART ocean bottom pressure data (3 stations, 10,603 records) contributed to the improvement. IOC sea level fetch crashed (None station codes → `AttributeError`), S-net requires NIED credentials (pending).

Stacking still underperforms best single model: Logistic 0.7404 vs HistGBT 0.7481 (−0.008). Correlated M5+/M5.5+/M6+ HistGBT predictions limit meta-learner diversity — Phase 14 addresses this.

### Phase 14: Diverse Stacking + ConvLSTM Export — Test AUC 0.7485

| Metric | Phase 13 | Phase 14 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV AUC (pooled) | **0.7416** | 0.7415 | −0.0001 |
| Test AUC | 0.7481 | **0.7485** | +0.0004 |
| Active features | 64/79 | 65/79 | +1 |

Stacking meta-learner with 14 diverse level-0 inputs (HistGBT×3 + RF×3 + LR×3 + physics×5):
- Logistic stacking: pooled AUC = 0.7484 (≒ base model, no improvement)
- Isotonic stacking: pooled AUC = 0.7213 (degraded)

ConvLSTM 4D feature matrix export (timesteps×11×11×65) completed. Ready for Colab GPU training.

**Key takeaway**: Stacking with correlated level-0 models does not improve on the best single model. Genuine diversity requires structurally different models (e.g., ConvLSTM spatiotemporal vs HistGBT tabular).

### Phase 14b: Data Acquisition Overhaul — 57→71+ active features

Phase 13 revealed that 15 out of 27 data sources had been silently failing (only 57/79 features had real data). Phase 14b systematically rewrites every broken fetch script, adds new sources, and verifies each with lightweight curl tests before committing:

| Source | Before (broken) | After (fixed) | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OLR** | PSL THREDDS NCSS (`accept=csv` unsupported, data through 2023) | NCEI CDR direct NetCDF download (through 2025, 2-day lag) | ✅ file listing |
| **GRACE gravity** | JPL PO.DAAC OPeNDAP (Earthdata 401) | GFZ GravIS RL06 TWS (public HTTPS, 496MB cached) | ✅ HEAD 200 |
| **Ocean color** | NASA OB.DAAC OPeNDAP (Earthdata 401, ended 2022) | CoastWatch ERDDAP `noaacwNPPN20S3ASCIDINEOF2kmDaily` (VIIRS+OLCI, 2018-present) | ✅ curl 2025 data |
| **Soil moisture** | NASA AppEEARS (Earthdata 401, ended 2022) | CPC ERDDAP (primary, 2011-present) + NOAA SMOPS (fallback, 2017-2022) | ✅ curl 2025 data |
| **Tide gauge** | UHSLC `.dat` files (404, URLs moved) | UHSLC ERDDAP `global_hourly_fast` (19 Japan stations, was 9) | ✅ curl 2025 data |
| **GOES X-ray** | LISIRD `goes_xrs_flare_daily` (endpoint removed) | LISIRD `noaa_goes16_xrs_1m` (2017+) + `goes15` (2011-2016), daily max | ✅ JSON both sats |
| **InSAR** | LiCSAR wrong frame IDs + broken catalog API | 34 correct Japan frames (Morishita 2021) + GeoTIFF parser + rasterio | ✅ JASMIN 200 |
| **IOC sea level** | `station.get("code")` crash on None values | None-safe parsing + dict/list response support + case-insensitive keys | ✅ station list |
| **Lightning** | Blitzortung archive restricted (no historical data) | **ISS LIS** via GHRC DAAC (2017-2023, CMR search + NetCDF) | ✅ CMR granules |
| **Nightlight** | Stub code (returned empty, 5% implemented) | **VNP46A4** HDF5 tile download + h5py parse (2012-present, annual) | ✅ LAADS catalog |
| **Cloud fraction** | Variable name `Cloud_Fraction_Mean_Mean` (wrong) | Fixed to `Cloud_Fraction_Mean` | ⏳ CI auth test |
| **SO2** | Filename pattern missing revision timestamp | OPeNDAP catalog-based filename discovery | ⏳ CI auth test |
| **Earthdata auth** | Bearer token stripped on cross-origin redirect (all OPeNDAP 401) | Username/password BasicAuth for URS redirect flow | ✅ secrets set |
| **Animal** | Movebank has no Japan GPS data | **Removed** (79→78 features) | — |

**Net result**: 11 broken sources fixed + 2 new sources (ISS LIS, VNP46A4) + 1 removed (animal). 8 sources switched to auth-free alternatives. All verified with curl before commit. Expected active features: **71-74/78** (from 57/79).

### Phase 15g Results — Test AUC 0.7540, 75 active features

| Metric | Phase 14 | Phase 15 | Phase 15g | Phase 15h | Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CV AUC (pooled) | **0.7415** | 0.7411 | 0.7415 | 0.7417 | ±0 |
| Test AUC | 0.7485 | 0.7499 | **0.7540** | 0.7540 | +0.0055 |
| Active features | 65/79 | 70/78 | **75/78** | 76/78 | +11 |
| Stacking (logistic) | 0.7484 | — | — | 0.7463 | — |

**Note**: Phase 15h added SO2 (408K rows) but AUC was unchanged because a coordinate mismatch bug prevented spatial data from reaching the ML model. Phase 15i fixes this — results pending.

**Data validation (Phase 15g: 25 OK / 4 EMPTY / 1 MISSING)**:

| Status | Tables |
|---|---|
| ✅ OK (25) | earthquakes, focal_mechanisms, tec, gnss_tec, geomag_kp, geomag_hourly, cosmic_ray, olr, earth_rotation, solar_wind, gravity_mascon, soil_moisture, ocean_color, goes_xray, goes_proton, tidal_stress, particle_flux, dart_pressure, ioc_sea_level, modis_lst, ulf_magnetic, cloud_fraction, iss_lis_lightning, **tide_gauge** (2.4M rows), **nightlight** (950 rows) |
| ❌ EMPTY (4) | so2_column, lightning, satellite_em, collector_status |
| ❌ MISSING (1) | snet_pressure (NIED approval pending) |

Phase 15h: **SO2 408,351行取得成功** (0→408K, OPeNDAP parser fix + Hyrax approval) but AUC unchanged — **coordinate mismatch bug discovered**: 7 spatial data loaders (OLR, GRACE, SO2, soil moisture, ocean color, cloud fraction, nightlight) were using raw data source coordinates as lookup keys instead of snapping to the 2° prediction grid via `cell_key()`. All spatial features from these sources were silently zero despite having data in the DB. Fixed in Phase 15i.

Phase 15i (running): Coordinate snap fix for all 7 spatial loaders + ZERO-HIT detection logging (warns when spatial source has data but 100% zero features). **AUC improvement expected** — multiple data sources contributing for the first time.

CSEP Benchmark: ML_HistGBT Molchan skill **0.9811** (best), beating Simple_ETAS (0.8713), Relative_Intensity (0.7745), Smoothed_Seismicity (0.2220).

Feature matrix exported to BigQuery (`geohazard.feature_matrix`: 216,711 rows, 132 MB) + Google Drive for Colab GPU experiments.

### GCP BigQuery Data Platform

GCP プロジェクト `data-platform-490901` の `geohazard` データセットに feature matrix + メタデータを集約。CI の ML フェーズ完了後に自動ロード。

**現在のテーブル・ビュー:**

| テーブル | 行数 | 内容 |
|---|---|---|
| `feature_matrix` | 216,711 | 全特徴量データ（Phase毎に上書き） |
| `feature_matrix_metadata` | 1+ | Phase別AUC・特徴量数の推移（追記） |
| `feature_nonzero_rates` | — | 特徴量別非ゼロ率（CI初回実行後に自動作成） |
| `v_auc_history` | view | AUC推移の可視化用 |
| `v_feature_summary` | view | 空間特徴量の非ゼロ率一覧（バグ検出） |

**BQ活用の成果**: Phase 15h で SO2 408K行取得成功にもかかわらず AUC が変わらなかった原因を、BQ 集計クエリ（`AVG(so2_column_anomaly) = 0.0`）で即座に発見。7つの空間データソースの座標ミスマッチバグ（Phase 15i で修正済み）を特定できた。

**今後の予定:**
- Phase 15i 完了後、非ゼロ率が 0% → 有意な値に変わることを `v_feature_summary` で確認
- Grafana ダッシュボード（`geohazard` データセット分）を作成予定
- 将来: 31テーブルの生データも BQ に蓄積し、CI の毎回ゼロフェッチ → 差分追加に切り替え
